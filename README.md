Shebang Java Example for JEEConf


This is a simple example how we (Java Engineers) can run Java code without implicit complilation. And this means that not we can use Unix-like OS's approach called "Shebang"!

## To execute with implicit compilation

`java --source 11 test.java`

## To execute through Shebang 

`./test`

### Enjoy !
